--For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
--Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

--Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

-- First I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track.

SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(popularity), AVG(danceability), AVG(energy) FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

--Then I determined who the Top 10 artists are by popularity.

SELECT artist_name, track_name FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC LIMIT 10; 

--Then I determined who the artists were that appeared in the top 50.

SELECT distinct artist_name FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

--Of those distinct artists, I determined the count of top songs each artist had.

SELECT artist_name, COUNT(*) FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
